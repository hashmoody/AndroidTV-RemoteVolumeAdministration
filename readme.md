I was so pissed with my kids raising the volume of the TV despite again & again saying that it should be lower than 10 when I work. But they do not understand. Luckily I came up with an idea & developed this.

To make this work, follow the steps:

1. Download the batch file in the releases.
2. Enable developer mode on the Android TV.
3. Note down the IP address of your TV.
4. Enter it in the app.
5. Set the desired volume & minimize the back to continue running in background.

Hope it helps. Use at your own risk.
